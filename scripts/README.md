# Scripts

This directory contains executable scripts that run specific tasks or workflows.

## What Goes Here

Scripts that:

- Train models end-to-end
- Generate reports
- Are meant to be executed directly, not imported
- _Ad hoc_ or one off tasks not requiring orchestration in airflow

See [`src/README.md`](../src/README.md) for more details on organizing your code.
