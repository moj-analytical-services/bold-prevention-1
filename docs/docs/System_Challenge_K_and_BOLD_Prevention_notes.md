## Part 1 — System Challenge K context (converted to Markdown, with no information removed)

# System Challenge K – Scope and Ambition: A focus on prevention and collaboration 

Amid high levels of demand on public services, the need to improve public sector productivity, and changing expectations and requirements of public services stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, Government is reflecting on how best to utilise resources to meet need and why a preventative approach isn't taken when we recognise that it is better than intervening at acute crisis stage. **How are circumstances different now to the previous 10-20 years?**

## Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that a more preventative approach to public spending, that focuses on intervening earlier to prevent problems before they develop and intervening earlier when they do, could both improve outcomes for high-needs cohorts and reduce demand on public services. 

## Why a cross-government approach is required
This work requires a cross-government approach, due to the interdependencies between departments impacting demand for public services. Activity in one area of government can drive upstream or downstream demand elsewhere, and therefore requires joint solutions – for example, strong joint working between probation, housing services and health can support can help ensure offenders access the support they need improving their outcomes across offending, homelessness and health, and potentially reducing longer term demand for those services. By taking a system-wide approach to reviewing this challenge, there is an opportunity to enhance collaboration to improve life outcomes.

## Aim of the overall “System Challenge” work
Our aim for this as an overall, ‘System Challenge’ piece of work is to: 
- Develop a shared evidence base where we understand the risk factors impacting outcomes, the drivers of demand across services, and the different cohorts and places where there may be opportunity to improve outcomes and reduce demand;
- Identify and shape joint policy options to that enable greater impact on early intervention and managing demand across services; 
- Identify systemic barriers to cross-government working and early intervention and develop proposals to address these in the long-term.  

---

## Defining “egregious” social outcomes
Through cross-government mapping, we identified the most egregious social outcomes. We are defining ‘egregious’ as:

- Patterns of public service provision which drives people up the ‘cost spiral’, thus ultimately fuels public spending to a higher level than otherwise needed.
- Exceptionally ineffective engagement from public services from a user perspective, with multiple reactive contact points which do not consider how a person got there or builds on strengths.
- Exceptionally high cost/volume areas of public services where there is a plausible set of preventative interventions that we could – but currently do not – do to flatten the curve of future demand and reduce future spending.  

---

## The six social outcomes used to frame the challenge
The six social outcomes that we used to frame the challenge, drawing on the existing evidence base and analysis, were:
- Offending (MOJ and HO)  
- Ill-health and early mortality (DHSC)  
- In-work poverty (DWP)  
- Long-term inactivity and unemployment (DWP)  
- Homelessness and home insecurity (DLUHC)  
- Poor child outcomes (DfE)

---

## Drivers of the six egregious social outcomes
See Cross-government demand mapping identified the drivers of the six egregious social outcomes: A set of common and overlapping risk factors drive those outcomes: **poor mental health; poor physical health/activity/nutrition; low income; substance misuse; employment; early years and education; accommodation; and family and marital.**

### Figure 1: Drivers of social outcomes
Analysts used publicly available evidence and frameworks to determine the key drivers or risk factors of each social outcome.

### Figure 2: Network analysis
MoJ analysts then mapped risk factors against social outcomes and explored their linkages, to produce a ‘map of maps’ or network analysis.

### Figure 3: Network of weighted links of drivers of outcomes
MoJ analysts rated the level of impact of cross-cutting drivers and the level of evidence to support this. 

---

## Complexity and analytical capability
Understanding the drivers of poor outcomes – what they are, how they manifest for different cohorts, including their relative strength – is incredibly complex and HMG does not have a strong understanding of the way multiple risk factors interact to drive poor life outcomes. This indicates that there is latent civil service capacity and capability to think across systems and, despite increase sophistication of our data and analytical capacity, there are still areas for improvement.

---

## Deep-dive focus: three ‘no-regrets’ areas with greatest potential impact
Leveraging our understanding of demand mapping across government and the range of interventions already in place, we agreed with XWH DGs to take a deep-dive approach, focusing on three ‘no-regrets’ areas with the greatest potential to make an impact.

### 1) Population wide health challenge (obesity): primary prevention  
This deep dive focuses on primary prevention for obesity – which is the most significant modifiable risk factor, after smoking, for the six major conditions which collectively are the greatest contributors to ill-health and early mortality.

**Rationale:**
- Good health is an asset, improving quality of life, supporting economic growth and reducing demand for public services. This is particularly the case if we can target and prevent the main causes of premature and disabling ill health - 'compressing' morbidity so people spend fewer years in ill health, later in their lives, and more years in good health.
- Obesity is growing in prevalence and leads to a range of poor outcomes: **12% of avoidable death and disability is attributable to high BMI; cost per person of severe obesity doubles that of someone with a healthy weight; obesity is associated with 38% higher probability of unemployment for age 50-65.**
- Trends indicate that these outcomes may worsen, with OECD estimating obesity causing increased labour costs, lowering GDP, reducing the workforce, and increasing the average tax rate between 2020-50.
- Tackling obesity is a shared responsibility across government, with different departments holding influence over wider factors that act directly on health or shape behaviour.

**NB:** Following the general election announcement, this deep dive is being taken forward directly by DHSC with HMT. 

### 2) Upstream targeting for vulnerable young people: secondary prevention  
This deep dive looks at secondary prevention opportunities to intervene earlier with children and young people, to prevent poorer outcomes later in life, avoid costs to the system and alleviate demand pressures.

**Rationale:** 
There are a rising numbers of children with needs and circumstances in childhood that lead to worsening outcomes:
- Child poverty and housing security – which acts as a backdrop to a range of poor outcomes. Rates of relative and absolute poverty rising since 2016/17 for families with 3 or more children.
- Whole family support – ensuring that a broader range of challenges for a child and their families are tackled to prevent longer term impacts (currently seen in rising CSC numbers, more complex needs, and poor outcomes).  
- Mental health and SEND – rising child MH and SEND, flowing into rising child DLA & 18-24 disability benefit claims (as well as pressure on the SEND system / LAs and wider poor outcomes)  
- Attainment and transitions into work – following re-widening of the attainment gap post covid, [increasing] NEET, [low attainment translating into poor employment outcomes]. 

Trends indicate that these outcomes may worsen: the overall rate of 16-18-year-olds who are NEET increased by **8.4% in 2022**, the highest rate since 2012. Without interventions, LAs will need to spend **£18.5bn by 2032-2** to meet children's social care demand.  

### 3) Vulnerable adults with multiple disadvantages: tertiary prevention  
This tertiary prevention deep dive looks at vulnerable adults with multiple disadvantages, defined by Changing Futures as those with overlapping experiences of homelessness, substance misuse, mental health issues, domestic abuse, and contact with the CJS.  

**Rationale:** 
- Vulnerable adults with MD require holistic service provision to address their interdependent needs. Effective join-up between local services is therefore required. This deep dive looks at how people interact with services from the bottom-up (local-level) and where the opportunities are to intervene earlier to prevent ('rescue’) at the multiple disadvantage stage. This will enable us to identify points for effective, targeted intervention to address risks earlier across issues, with a focus on delivering joined-up services that increase the likelihood of an individual maintaining their health, housing and employment.
- MD represents a high cost to the system, with high needs individuals interacting with multiple different public services repeatedly: for example, those on the Fulfilling Lives programme cost public services an average of over **£28,000 per year**.
- With demand on public services on the rise, problems for this cohort will continue to worsen without foundational services in place to support them:
  - In 2023, mental health services recorded **5 million referrals**, up **33% from 2012**;
  - demand for prison places is outstripping supply;
  - a record **112,000 households were homeless and living in temporary accommodation in December 2023** (a **12.1% increase** from the previous year).

---

## International comparators
- A ‘whole system’ approach which focuses on tackling the drivers of poor outcomes has produced positive results: over **500 communities** in high-income countries have trialled a ‘Communities that Care’ intervention, which uses a community-level, cross-system preventative approach to decrease risk, enhance protection and reduce mental-risking behaviour in youth. This has effectively prevented delinquency, violence, and substance abuse amongst young people.
- There is benefit in bringing together wraparound support services into a single location, particularly for those with complex needs: **Common Ground** is a programme available in some cities in the USA and Australia which offers wraparound support for vulnerable adults with multiple disadvantages in a single building. Success has been indicated by high retention rates, however, there are some negative unintended effects of co-locating people with complex needs.
- Several countries have allocated specific funding to tackle cross-system social challenges, which has proved beneficial: The Australian government provides funding to support several measures related to student mental health including a new voluntary mental health check to ensure students get the support they need.​

---

## Expert thinkers
- External experts believed there are opportunities for better cross-government working to improve outcomes: The House of Lords Public services Committee’s inquiry into transitions from education to employment for young disabled people highlighted the lack of joined-up thinking across government for this cohort and advocated for a ‘one-stop shop’ approach.
- Experts also advocate for funding changes to promote greater investment in preventative activity and encourage spending cross-cutting challenges:
  - The Independent Review into Children’s Social Care found that the system has become overwhelmingly focused on the costliest, crisis end of intervention. It recommended a shift in the way CSC services respond to families who need help by creating a new Family help service, which is adequately funded by actors across government. ​
  - To address multiple and complex needs, the Future Governance Forum ‘Place-Based Public Service Budgets’ proposes understanding total local public spending and bringing together local services to plan how to best spend that money, with more responsibility given to local areas and greater involvement from local communities. 
- Experts have identified opportunities to take a more person-centred approach to achieve intended outcomes:
  - Academics promoted the ‘Liberated Method’ as a flexible, person centred approach to public services for those with MD. It recommends focusing on the needs of the individual, rather than delivery of a pre-defined service.
  - The Centre for Social Justice advocates for a whole family approach to prevention, bringing services together before they escalate. 

---

## Equalities
There are complex disparities in the representation and experience of men and women across various outcomes and risk factors:
- While most adults with MD are male, women are more likely to have experienced domestic violence, and this in turn makes them more likely to have other disadvantages including contact with the CJS, mental health problems, homelessness, and substance abuse.
- In younger people, boys are more likely to have an identified SEND need (**21.9% vs 12.2% of girls**), while young women under 24 are almost three times more likely to experience a common mental disorder such as anxiety or depression.

Poor outcomes and associated risk factors are disproportionately represented among ethnic minorities: people from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities experience a range of socioeconomic disadvantages which contribute to their experience of multiple disadvantages. 

There are clear links between individuals with experience of care and poor outcomes and disability, which is overrepresented in the population experience multiple disadvantages.  

---

## Geographies
Poor outcomes are disproportionate concentrated in more deprived areas: there are large geographic differences in the percentage of children with a good level of development, ranging from **55% in the most deprived neighbourhoods to 75% in the leas deprived areas.** MD is also associated with areas with high rates of unemployment and/or poverty.

There are regional disparities between places that experience poor outcomes and variation between local authorities in the quality of services and in their overall financial position: MD was found to be heavily concentrated in Northern cities, some seaside towns and central London boroughs; higher levels of absolute poverty were identified in the North, Midlands, and London (after housing costs), as well as higher rates of NEET (young people not in education, employment, or training) in the North East.

## Common themes: systemic change is required to overcome barriers in prevention

### 1) Opportunities to improve central government processes to support prevention

#### Funding  
There is a lack of clarity around prevention and preventative spending. Current funding processes are also too short term and act as a barrier to joined up XWH working. Funding is largely allocated on a short-term basis i.e. 1-3 years making it hard for preventative programmes to plan for the long term. Political pressures also mean that funding is skewed towards acute pressures rather than longer term strategies that would take years, or even decades, to see the benefit.

Options to address this include:
- Long-term funding horizons (over more than one spending cycle) to secure buy-in for necessarily long-term preventative policies;
- Cross-department funding bids, devolution of budgets or central pooling of budgets – recognising that savings often do not accrue where preventions spend is invested.
- Approaches to evaluation and options appraisal which respond to systemic interventions rather than issue-based interventions and give weight to benefits beyond short-term cashable savings.
- Ringfencing for prevention that is underpinned by evidence and governed by “rules”. 
- Developing ‘ready-reckoners’ on how costs flow through and technocratic measures.

#### Governance  
A common barrier to cross-cutting preventative work identified throughout this work is the siloed structure and culture of government, as preventative policies often require cross-departmental collaboration. Currently, departments tend to work in isolation and focus on their own policy areas. There is also a lack of data sharing across government, which further prevents XWH strategic join up.

Options to address this include:
- Mission delivery boards as a way of cross-government collaboration to overcome working in silos and to design interventions to address people's in the round rather than thematic service interventions.
- Bolder use of non-spending levers, such as regulation, tax, behavioural nudges.  

#### Data
Creating a common data-sharing framework across OGDs could help standardise this process so that we can maximise the usage of data between and across departments. To conduct robust, comprehensive demand mapping, government would need to ensure that individual data sets are complete and then develop ‘data linking’ infrastructure for modelling. 

#### Evidence and Evaluation  
There is limited evidence around preventative interventions to support their funding and implementation. This is partly because of time taken to have an impact e.g. Sure Start evaluation has only just been released a decade after the programme ended. It can also be difficult to prove causality between upstream interventions like social action and sports programmes and downstream outcomes, especially as there are often interrelated programmes targeting similar outcomes.

Options to address this include:
- Drawing more evidence from international examples
- Encouraging more experimental and ambitious pilots and policies
- Embedding prevention into spending and performance frameworks, perhaps by improving the current ODP system.  

### 2) Local systems changes to help partners deliver preventative services

#### National vs Local  
Current funding and governance is overcentralised, meaning that while local authorities are largely responsible for delivering preventative interventions, they often have limited scope to influence or design preventative policies according to their specific needs. This leaves local services struggling to support vulnerable cohorts, as central government does not make policies or allocate funding in line with locally-specific needs.

Options to address this include:
- More flexible, responsive, person-centred local services rather than nationally prescribed threshold for access to services
- Data sharing and join up services to spot warning triggers of repetitive use earlier and detect users bouncing between services
- Flexibility of local funding to support focus on prevention.
- Refreshing strategic relationships with the VDS.

## Policy ideas – what are our ‘big bets’ in these deep-dive areas?
As well as changes at national and local level, we have identified some 'big bets' we are keen to land with any potential incoming government. 

While we paused the formal commissioning of our planned ‘Phase 2’ work on developing policy options, we have maintained engagement with our deep-dive leads to conduct several workshops to identify these 'big bets'. 

### Upstream Targeting for Vulnerable Young People: Lead Policy Options

#### Scope of Services  
Providing universal provision of positive services (e.g. youth activities and clubs) alongside targeted help to families with multiple problems, improving outcomes and driving down demand for significantly more expensive services i.e. child in care, youth justice system, long term benefit demand, NEET.

#### Mental Health  
a focus across government on children’s mental health, particularly acute given the impact of the pandemic, social media etc.  

#### Other Policy Options:
- Workforce Provision: We will need the right workforce across public services to deliver support and prevention. Important to examine a long-term plan to foster this workforce.
- SEND & Disability: Joint work between DWP & DfE, on importance of early identification and support, providing effective services, focused on positive life outcomes, maximising employment outcomes, and reducing benefit dependency, with a particular focus on opportunities for better identification and support in the early years.
- School Attendance: Improving school attendance is an important goal to surround vulnerable children with stability and structure.   

#### 'Process' Options:
- Long-term focus on Prevention: Making the case for greater, multi-year intervention funding in the long run, to avoid high numbers of children in custody or other difficulties five/ten years down the line. 
- LA as Strategic Partner: Getting our cross-government approach to this right is vital to delivering any reforms successfully. We need to make sure the partnership with LA and stakeholders/the third sector is as effective as possible. This includes consideration of funding, multiple grants, local partner infrastructure, and the capability to drive innovation & change.
- Government Structure and Spending Review Bids: should departments bid on prevention (e.g. MoJ), it may be other departments which see the benefits. How do we ensure that how the mechanisms of central govt are there to support this cohort when provision will need to come from a range of departments? How do we strike the right balance between building long-term preventative focus but without losing focus (and ringfence?) on children already in the criminal justice system, for example?  

#### Crucial Focus:
Mental Health: there is a need to focus on mental health to prevent risk factors from emerging amongst children, particularly given the effects of the pandemic and rising social media use. 

#### Early years/family services  
Early years intervention and whole family support has provided foundational in improving outcomes and reducing costs. This is reflected in the success of Sure Start, which provided support for local families through a range of services with the aim of enhancing development and life chances of children under 5. Evaluation shows that children who lived close to a Sure Start centre for their first 5 years performed better in their GCSEs by **0.8 grades** and there was a reduction in the likelihood of having an Education, Care, and Health Plan by age 16.   

#### Alignment with Manifesto Commitments: CONSERVATIVES
The Conservatives have also made commitments to improve skills and opportunities for young people by investing in apprenticeships and implementing National Service for 18-year-olds and increasing childcare for families. They will also open mental health  ‘early support hubs’ for 11–25-year-olds.  

#### Alignment with Manifesto Commitments: LABOUR
The Labour ‘Opportunity’ Mission has a strong focus on early years and young people. There are specific references to some of the common risk factors we identified as impacting social outcomes, such as mental health, SEND and childrens social care. 
- Family - Family support and child poverty through benefits and improved data-sharing between services and ensure families don’t fall through the cracks with a single unique identifier.
- SEND and Mental Health – Community-wide approach to improve services for SEND.
- Universal services – ‘Expanding Experiences’ with Art, Music and Sport.
- The Safer Streets mission's commitment to halving knife crime in 10 years alongside a greater focus on prevention will rely on more effective and joined-up interventions with at-risk teenagers.

## Vulnerable Adults with Multiple Disadvantages: 'Process' Options
- Adopting an equality lens to ensure specific needs of female offenders, offenders from an ethnic minority background and those from other protected characteristics are supported.
- Strengthening the use of Justice Impact Tests (JITs) to ensure we increase the use of JITs for all upstream policy changes across government that have an impact on downstream demand, and that the department is compensated for the associated costs of the policy changes. 
- Data: Create a common data-sharing framework across OGDs to help standardise this process so that we can maximise the usage of data between and across departments.
- Female offenders: Share the burden for funding the women's community sector across all departments/agencies who benefit (e.g. health service and substance misuse services benefitting from co-location at women's centres).
- Female offenders: Support the implementation of Whole Systems Approaches at a local level to better support complex women. A WSA in all local areas would see improved collaboration between agencies/services with more women offered earlier intervention and diverted away from the CJS.
- Commissioning: Work on a devolved/pooled local commissioning model to create integrated Health & Justice teams with pooled budgets, including probation services who will be best placed to support the needs of those in their communities.
- Working to ensure funding restrictions are not a significant barrier to this cohort requiring support.  

### Policy Options:
- Changing Futures (DULHC to add), including a focus on housing.
- Diversion: To fund and commission bespoke mental health treatment interventions for diversionary OOCDs.
- Diversion:  Support cross-gov coalescence around the need to intervene early and effectively divert away from the CJS into a more appropriate service.
- Strengthen existing services in their support of these cohorts.
- Health: To support, co-create and fund a cross-government public health strategy for crime reduction which the addresses the social determinants of poor health and crime. This would mark a shift away from thinking about crime and violence as individual pathology and towards thinking about it as a public health issue. 
- Multiple complex needs: To pilot a flagging scheme to identify people making multiple contacts with agencies - showing complex needs and escalating requests for support. Explore how information systems could support staff across health and justice to identify people with multiple complex needs (MCN)
- Early intervention: Use jobcentres/schools/GPs/ frontline services as opportunity for early intervention through identifying and signposting vulnerable to appropriate support.  

### Crucial Focus:
- Housing: even when efforts are made to improve system join-up for this cohort, severing housing shortages are a barrier to access that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable. The system for the supply and delivery of supported housing needs to be rebuilt. This is a key preventative intervention for adults at risk of or experiencing MD, who are at risk of housing insecurity, homelessness and rough sleeping without suitable accommodation and support. This in turn drives negative outcomes including poor physical and mental health and being victims and/or perpetrators of crime and ASB. 
- Health: MD is associated with a poor high health profile, indicating a link between poor health outcomes and MD. Policy options also note a need to focus on a public health strategy for crime reduction.  

### Alignment with Manifesto Commitments :  CONSERVATIVES
LAs will be given multi-year funding to support social care and continue plans to end rough sleeping through the LA Housing Fund.  

### Alignment with Manifesto Commitments :  LABOUR
The Labour manifesto pledges to intervene earlier to stop young people being drawn into crime, creating a new Young Futures programme with a network of hubs reaching every community. These hubs will have youth workers, mental health support workers, and careers advisers.

## Ensuring effective delivery of demand prevention doesn’t end here: We are keen to:
- Using our cross-Whitehall Senior Working Group as a community of practice.
- We propose immediate next steps for this group to continue to work virtually on cross-cutting prevention and early intervention proposals, including relating to thinking on the Labour mission on opportunity and Cabinet Office coordination of those, and to take stock after the election on continued meeting as a community of practice.
- Embed a Prevention First approach across government, by agreeing a shared definition and approach. 

As per HMT's 2024 Prevention Framework, we have defined prevention as **'an intervention that prevents further downstream costs and/or produces better outcomes for the public in areas of social policy’.** There are three ways of categorising prevention:
1. Primary prevention – preventing a problem from occurring in the first place (e.g. early years family based-interventions)
2. Secondary prevention – intervening early when a problem starts to emerge to prevent it becoming established (e.g. therapeutic foster care)
3. Tertiary prevention – making sure an ongoing problem is well-managed to avoid crises and reduce its harmful consequences (e.g. victim/offender mediation)

We can go further and develop a Prevention First mission with our devolved partners, local authorities and the third sector.

- Feed this thinking into briefings for incoming ministers, using one cross-government voice where possible.
- Alongside HMT, use this work to inform potential joint spending-review bids and long-term planning.
- Continue gathering rich data to inform our approach.

## Part 2 — Practical implementation stages for BOLD Prevention (mapped to the MoJ/BOLD data-linking discovery approach)

The attached MoJ/BOLD discovery pack sets out a **data-linking-specific Discovery** with seven stages and clear role expectations across policy, analysts/data science, and service design.  
Below are implementation stages for the **BOLD Prevention SPEC** (Projects 1–3), using that structure, and then extending into delivery/pilots/scale.

### Stage 0 — Scope your discovery (mobilise + boundaries)
**Purpose:** Avoid “boil the ocean” and make discovery tractable.

**Actions for BOLD Prevention**
- Fix the initial boundary using System Challenge K:
  - pick **one deep-dive cohort** to prioritise for early value (e.g., MD adults; vulnerable young people) *and* one **cross-cutting outcome** (e.g., offending + homelessness, or child outcomes + MH/SEND).
- Explicitly decide:
  - Are we scoping a **programme** (multi-year) or **one linkage project**?
  - Do we include **operational linking** (frontline single view) now, or only **strategic/policy** linking first?
- Define “Discovery exit criteria” up front:
  - clear use-case shortlist,
  - mapped data landscape + maturity assessment,
  - IG route identified (DPIA/DSAs/MoUs),
  - a recommended option with resources/timeline/risks.

### Stage 1 — Stakeholder engagement (continuous, but structured)
**Purpose:** Joint ownership, trust, and feasibility.

**Actions**
- Build a stakeholder map that includes:
  - policy owners for the six outcomes,
  - data owners/controllers,
  - delivery partners (LBBD, Community Help Partnerships),
  - governance: IG/DPO/security, safe outputs, AQA reviewers,
  - lived experience reps where appropriate.
- Run a “cross-system journey” workshop per deep dive:
  - map where users “bounce” between services (a named System Challenge K issue),
  - identify where earlier touchpoints exist (jobcentres/schools/GPs/frontline).

**Outputs**
- Stakeholder map + comms plan; RACI; engagement cadence; agreed decision forum.

### Stage 2 — Problem definition (and theory of change)
**Purpose:** Prevent solution-first thinking.

**Actions**
- Translate System Challenge K into **problem statements** that are measurable:
  - e.g., “Repeated reactive contact points and cost spiral for MD adults due to fragmented service visibility.”
- Build a **theory of change** for each of Projects 1–3:
  - how national asset → better planning,
  - how national–local linking → earlier detection & coordinated action,
  - how analytics/LLMs → better identification/triage/policy design.

**Outputs**
- 1–2 page problem definition per priority deep dive + theory of change diagram.

### Stage 3 — Insight gathering (data landscape + user/system understanding)
**Purpose:** Evidence-led feasibility.

**Actions**
- **User/system mapping:** current process maps for:
  - local referrals, assessments, casework,
  - where data is captured (structured vs free text).
- **Data mapping:** identify datasets for:
  - the six outcomes,
  - the shared risk factors (mental health, income, substance misuse, accommodation, etc.),
  - interventions and service contacts (to observe “cost spiral” patterns).
- Request **safe samples** (where permissible) or run analysis in trusted environments to assess:
  - identifier completeness,
  - timeliness,
  - data quality and coding consistency,
  - linkage feasibility.

**Outputs**
- Data landscape map + “maturity” scorecards,
- initial descriptive insights (coverage by geography/time; known bias risks),
- draft data dictionaries.

### Stage 4 — Options/opportunity development (use-case-led)
**Purpose:** Create deliverable options where **high user value overlaps with robust data**.

**Actions**
- Co-create use cases (½–1 page each) for both:
  - **Strategic/policy** value (national prevalence, cohort discovery, intervention evaluation),
  - **Operational** value (frontline single view; flagging multiple contacts).
- For each use case, define:
  - actor/persona,
  - trigger,
  - step-by-step workflow,
  - desired outcome,
  - system/policy requirements (consent/IG, access, timeliness, product channel).

**Outputs**
- Use case library + prioritised backlog,
- mapping: use case → required datasets → identifiers → feasible linkage approach.

### Stage 5 — Stress-test options (doable, sustainable, appropriate)
**Purpose:** Decide what will actually work.

**Actions**
- Run structured stress tests per option:
  - IG route complexity (DPIA/DSAs/MoUs),
  - data robustness (missingness, timeliness, linkage error risk),
  - operational readiness (frontline workflow, governance, safe outputs),
  - equity impacts (gender/ethnicity/disability/geography risks),
  - benefits realisation and evaluation feasibility.
- Include a “what we will *not* do” section for each option (to manage expectations).

**Outputs**
- Options paper with scored trade-offs + recommended option(s),
- linkage quality plan (false match/missed match estimation; drift monitoring),
- evaluation/benefits plan (including “impactability” questions).

### Stage 6 — Scope definition and planning (turn the option into a delivery plan)
**Actions**
- Convert the chosen option(s) into:
  - a scoped delivery plan (resourcing, milestones),
  - an IG pack plan (DPIA, DSAs/MoUs, Five Safes, safe outputs),
  - a technical plan (pipelines, linkage approach, monitoring),
  - an adoption plan (who uses outputs, how, and when).

**Outputs**
- Delivery plan for Projects 1–3 (with dependencies),
- benefits tracking plan and AQA checkpoints.

### Stage 7 — Decision point (proceed / pivot / pause / stop)
**Purpose:** Ethical, informed decision-making.

**Actions**
- Provide senior leaders with:
  - the recommended plan + costs/resources,
  - explicit risks (incl. equity and public trust),
  - what is excluded,
  - the value proposition to BOLD/MoJ priorities and cross-government demand reduction.

**Output**
- Signed decision + mobilisation of delivery teams.

## Part 3 — How to use the “data discovery tool” + use cases to initiate and develop data linking (with insight ideas)

The discovery pack’s core idea is: **blend user needs discovery with data landscape discovery** to find the overlap that is worth building.  
Here’s a practical way to operationalise that for BOLD Prevention.

### A) Set up a “Use case → Data → Linkage” pipeline (repeatable playbook)

1) **Build a use-case backlog first (not a dataset wishlist)**
- Start from System Challenge K “egregious” definition:
  - cost spiral trajectories,
  - ineffective reactive engagement,
  - high cost/volume areas with plausible preventions.
- Ensure the backlog spans:
  - **Primary** (planning/resource allocation),
  - **Secondary** (early warning/triage),
  - **Tertiary** (recurrence reduction + impactability).

2) **For each use case, create a “minimum viable data specification”**
- Outcomes to measure (offending, homelessness, MH crisis, NEET, etc.)
- Risk factors to represent (mental health, accommodation, substance misuse, income…)
- Intervention exposure(s) (who received what, when)
- Time windows (“as at” rules) to avoid leakage for any predictive outputs

3) **Use the MoJ data discovery tool to locate and qualify candidate datasets**
Even if the internal tool differs by platform, the workflow is consistent:
- Search by:
  - outcome domain (e.g., “homelessness”, “reoffending”, “SEND”),
  - risk factor domain (e.g., “mental health”, “substance misuse”),
  - geography/time granularity needs (local authority, monthly/weekly).
- Capture a standard metadata record:
  - owner/controller, access route, sensitivity, update frequency,
  - available identifiers (and completeness),
  - key variables, code lists, data quality notes,
  - safe setting availability.

**Tip:** maintain a single “data landscape register” that becomes the national asset’s living index.

4) **Linkage feasibility screening (fast triage before deep work)**
For each candidate linkage pair/triple, score:
- identifier availability + completeness,
- timeliness (can it support operational use?),
- expected linkage error risk,
- legal/consent route complexity,
- expected value if linked.

5) **Only then do deeper assessment**
- Request safe samples or run analysis in trusted environments:
  - missingness,
  - duplicate rates,
  - stability over time,
  - coding consistency.
- Draft the linkage design:
  - deterministic vs probabilistic,
  - temporal join semantics (“as-of” joins),
  - linkage quality measurement plan.

### B) Use cases that naturally fall out of System Challenge K (starter set)

Below are examples you can use to kick-start the backlog (each should become a ½–1 page use case in the discovery pack format):

#### Strategic / policy use cases (national asset + planning)
- **Needs prevalence by locality**: met/unmet needs across accommodation, MH, substance misuse, income; mapped to the six outcomes.
- **Cost spiral trajectories**: common sequences of multi-service contact that precede high-cost outcomes (e.g., homelessness → ED MH contacts → offending).
- **Cohort discovery**: “vulnerable young people at risk of NEET + later justice contact” (link education/truancy/SEND proxies to later outcomes in safe, pseudonymised form).
- **Impactability**: where flagship interventions appear to work best/worst (place, cohort, timing), with uncertainty explicitly reported.

#### Operational / frontline use cases (national–local + single view)
- **Multiple-contact flagging** (System Challenge K policy option): identify individuals/households with escalating repeated contacts across agencies; trigger proactive multi-agency review.
- **Earlier warning triggers**: detect patterns of “bouncing between services” and surface a structured view to practitioners (not automated decisions).
- **Household single view**: combine local resident data with national justice signals to support personalised interventions (initially LBBD pilot, built for scalability).

#### NLP/LLM-enabled use cases (only where lawful + safe)
- **Unmet need extraction** from case notes/referrals where structured fields miss key needs (e.g., housing insecurity indicators).
- **Structured summarisation** for practitioners (with strict grounding, audit, and human review).

### C) Insights you can generate quickly during discovery (before full linkage)

These are “early value” analyses you can run on first-iteration datasets (e.g., SAIL/DataFirst and/or safe extracts), to show momentum while IG/linkage work progresses:

1) **Risk factor overlap map**
- Recreate/extend the “map of maps” network using actual admin data proxies:
  - which risk factors co-occur most and for whom,
  - which are most predictive of downstream high-cost outcomes.

2) **Geographic concentration**
- Identify hotspots where poor outcomes cluster (and where service capacity/financial stress is highest), aligned to the System Challenge K geography findings.

3) **Service interaction patterns**
- Quantify “reactive contact points” and churn between services:
  - counts of contacts,
  - rapid repeat contacts,
  - transitions between service types.

4) **Equity lens dashboards**
- Track differences by sex, ethnicity (where lawful/available), disability/SEND proxies, care experience proxies, and deprivation:
  - linkage coverage,
  - outcome rates,
  - intervention reach.

### D) Governance and trust built into the discovery outputs (don’t bolt on later)

For each prioritised use case, your discovery outputs should include:
- **Purpose + public benefit statement** (why linkage is necessary and proportionate)
- **IG route map** (DPIA/DSA/MoU needs; roles and responsibilities)
- **Five Safes controls** (especially Safe Outputs)
- **AQA plan** (what gets peer reviewed, when)
- **Linkage quality plan** (false match/missed match estimation + subgroup drift checks)
